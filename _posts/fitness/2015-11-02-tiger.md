###于我，过去，现在以及未来
#####西格里夫·萨松
In me, past, present, future meet，

To hold long chiding conference. 

My lusts usurp the present tense 

And strangle Reason in his seat. 

My loves leap through the future's fence 

To dance with dream-enfranchised feet. 

In me the cave-man clasps the seer, 

And garlanded Apollo goes 

Chanting to Abraham's deaf ear. 。

In me the tiger sniffs the rose. 心有猛虎，细嗅蔷薇。

Look in my heart, kind friends, and tremble, 

Since there your elements assemble.
